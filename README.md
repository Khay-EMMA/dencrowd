# Smart Contract Flow🥑🍕

- User(Admin) will start a Campaign or a Project for fundraising with a Specific Goal and Deadline💖

- Contributors will contribute to that project by sending the required Tokens(in this case Hydro).😋💵

- The User(Admin) will create a Spending Request every time he wants to use any amount from those funds😁

- The Contributors will vote for that Spending Request.😮

- If more than 50% of the total contributors vote for that request then the User(admin) will get permission to use the amount mentioned in the Spending Request🎉🔥

- The contributors can withdraw their Hydro if the required amount(Goal) was not raised within the Deadline💔
